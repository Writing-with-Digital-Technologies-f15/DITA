 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Network lighting operates at a low level of networking power but can successfully
  connect at long distances because they can send information from light bulb to light
  bulb.</p>

  <p class="p">The remote control and light bulbs communicate with each other using a low-power wireless
   networking technology. In this low-power network, the wireless devices are able to interact with
   each other over the network by sending data from one device to the next, using the best radio
   signal path on the network. This path does not have to be a direct connection between the remote
   control and a network light bulb. It can be through any combination of network light bulbs on the
   low-power network. So, while a network light bulb in a distant room might not be able to
   communicate directly with the remote control, it can communicate with another nearby network
   light bulb that will pass the signal across the low-power network until it reaches the remote
   control.</p>

  <p class="p">Since wireless devices on a low-power network have built-in antennas for radio communication
   with other connected devices, they may be prone to the same reception problems that you might
   have with your mobile phone inside a building. Your remote control can have trouble communicating
   with the network lighting if their radio signals are blocked by obstacles such as large metal
   panels or walls containing wire mesh.</p>

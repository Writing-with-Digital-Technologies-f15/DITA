                    remote control’s primary indicator light flashes rapidly. When the light bulb
                    has been successfully added to the network, it will turn on at full brightness
                    and the remote control’s primary indicator will turn on solid for five seconds
                    and return to normal operation mode. If no light bulb has been successfully

                    will continue to flash for up to five minutes and then automatically return to
                    normal operation. If the indicator flashes red, the lighting group was not
                    activated and you must try again. Light flashes red for 3 seconds if programming
                    fails.</div>

                    will automatically find the new light bulb without you pressing any buttons, and
                    it will add the bulb to the same lighting group. However, if the indicator light
                    has stopped flashing, then you must repeat step 6. Repeat this for each

                    Both the primary indicator light and the group number indicator light turn off

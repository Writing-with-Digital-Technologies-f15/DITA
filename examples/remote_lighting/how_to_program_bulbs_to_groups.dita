            <p>Your remote control can manage up to 250 network light bulbs on the same lighting
                network. When you add a light bulb to the network, you can program it to one or more
                lighting groups. You must assign a light bulb to at least one lighting group to
                operate that light bulb.<note>A network light bulb that is not programmed to a
                    lighting group will still operate when controlling all network light bulbs from
                    the remote control.</note></p>

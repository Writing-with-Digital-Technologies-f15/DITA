	<title>Prose and Github</title>
		<shortdesc>What you need to know about how Prose works with Github.</shortdesc>
		
		<conbody>
			<p>Everything posted onto Prose.io, if that account is connected to a repo on Github for
		the other members of your group to view and make comments on.every time they make a change, they 
		are effectively submitting a new document into Github. They will still be then able to see past 
		versions of their document on the site, but any comments made on the previous submissions will be 
		left with that version of the document.</p>
			<p>Here are some other reasons you may not see what you expected on Github.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If there is an extended line of content which appears as though it was supposed
				to be a paragraph, that paragraph may not be aligned properly in the Prose file.</li>
				<li>Headings work by using the #, three being an H2 and two being an H3.</li>
				<li>Every so often it may be necessary to Authorize Your Account on Github.</li>
			</ul>

    <title>The Prose.io editor</title>
    <shortdesc>A brief explanation of Prose.io</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Prose.io is an editor for GitHub. When you authorize Prose.io with your GitHub account, it shows all of your GitHub repositories. When you create or edit a file with Prose.io, all changeds are commited to the directory that you specified. This means that you must have a GitHub Account to use Prose.io, as it does not actually store any files itself.</p>
        <p>You can think of Prose.io as a text/markdown editor (like the one you'd use on your computer) that takes care of uploading/commiting your files to GitHub for you.</p>

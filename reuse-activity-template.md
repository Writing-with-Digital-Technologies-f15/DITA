## Questions about reuse practices

**Note**: You can cite longer snippets of code by using markdown's code syntax highlighting like this:

```xml
<steps>
	<step>
		<cmd>Locate source materials</cmd>
	</step>
	<step>
		<cmd>Gather the evidence</cmd>
	</step>
	<step>
		<cmd>Write out the answer</cmd>
	</step>
</steps>
```

Answer the initial 2 questions by using the examples in this repo. Otherwise, use your books to answer the remaining questions. Be sure to integrate page number citations within each response.

### 1. What content is being reused, if any, in the example topic models? What DITA reuse methods are being used? Write out the particular components with the syntax.


### 2. In your book, list out some general reuse cases in DITA.


### 3. What are some good **phrase-level** conref practices?


### 4. What are some good **topic reuse** practices?


### 5. Define "spaghetti code" in relationship to conrefs.


### 6. Define the <code>copy-to</code> attribute and write out an example case.


### 7. Since we are not using a DITA-aware text editor, consider why an <code>id</code>-writing scheme will prove to be important. Come up with some rules of thumb for the class.


### 8. Consider how to integrate the reuse guidelines (pp. 199-200) into our writing and revision habits.
